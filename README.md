GitHub Workflow Example (gw_example)
===================================

This is a simple Drupal installation profile for exercises demonstrating Git/GitHub/Acquia Cloud workflows.

Install Example like any Drupal website. Just select the "Example" profile during installation. Once the site is installed, the home page should have a simple poem-making form. This form is generated by the Poem module in sites/all/poems. Practice workflows include:

    - Forking the project to your own repository
    - Testing your work in an Acquia Cloud development environment
    - Testing your work in your local development environment
    - Modifying the Poem project
    - Submitting your changes as a GitHub "pull request"
    - Code reviewing the pull request on GitHub
    - Merging in changes from the pull request on GitHub
